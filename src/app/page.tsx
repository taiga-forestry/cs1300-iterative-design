          <p className="text-14">
            Partiful is one of the most popular event planning platforms
            targeted towards the Gen Z and Millennial demographic. Compared to
            competitors like Eventbrite and Facebook, Partiful is highly
            customizable, enabling users to truly capture the vibe of their
            party or event and delight their guests.
          </p>

          <p className="text-14">
            Our group was tasked with designing new additions to Partiful&apos;s
            Event Customization Page, which is where users create and customize
            their events before inviting guests. In particular, our goal was to
            make the page customization experience even more
            &quot;Partiful&quot; ‚Äî to prompt unexpected delight, irreverence,
            and FUN! üíÉüï∫ A more flushed out version of our problem statement
            can be found in our <Link

          <p className="text-14 italic">
            Note: since Partiful has an established platform and design system,
            our aim was not a complete redesign. Instead, our goal was to
            introduce new, additional features on top of the existing interface
            and functionality that would enhance the user experience of event
            page customizations.

          <p className="text-14">
            To kickstart the design process, we began by examining the existing
            features Partiful offers and brainstorming a laundry list of
            potential features to add to the Partifulines of the event
            customization page. Eventually, we arrived at the following set of
            ideas to start:
          </p>

                Incorporating music into the invite pages sent to guests
              </li>
              <li> Title font customization </li>
              <li>
                Animated or interactive cover images (e.g. by including guest
                faces in the image)
              </li>
              <li>
                Custom page theme generators, either through AI or a
                color/gradient selector
              </li>
              <li> Custom emojis/messages for RSVP-ing to events </li>
              <li> Ability to tag events (e.g. by rave, birthday, etc.) </li>
              <li>
                Custom layout options for invite pages, possibly creatable via a
                drag-and-drop interface
              </li>
            </ul>

          <p className="text-14">
            In the end, we decided to adopt the third font customization sketch,
            first theme customization sketch, and first music customization
            sketch for our final set of wireframes, which showcase our initial
            designs for said features. The main design considerations for each
            feature we added are as follows:
          </p>

          <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-20 p-16">
            <div>
              <p className="text-14 font-bold underline">Music</p>
              <p className="text-14">
                We decided to go with adding music on top of the title, instead
                of on the side toolbar, as we believed that from the invitee‚Äôs
                perspective, the option to play and pause the music would be
                more intuitive to find when located above the title.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p className="text-14 font-bold underline">Fonts</p>
              <p className="text-14">
                We narrowed down our design to either utilize the larger modal
                or the smaller side pop-up, and we eventually decided on using
                the smaller side pop-up since it would allow users to view the
                effect of changing the title font without having to constantly
                open/close a modal.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p className="text-14 font-bold underline">Theme Customization</p>
              <p className="text-14">
                We decided on keeping both options for creating custom themes:
                using generative AI and a gradient/color selector, as we
                believed that the additional flexibility to allow users to craft
                their invitations to their liking would encourage them to use
                Partiful over other software lacking similar levels of theme
                customization.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p className="text-14">
            We decided not to go with our cover image customization and other
            laundry list items, mostly either due to us perceiving the features
            as either more technically difficult to implement (for engineers) or
            simply less of a priority for Partiful as a business.

                <li>
                  They were slightly opposed to the complexity of the AI
                  generation and vast range of options for creating a custom
                  color/gradient theme background, citing concerns of low
                  contrast, poor readability, and clutteredness of the theme
                  customization UI
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instead, they preferred for us to incorporate the color
                  customization into their existing themes, e.g. by being able
                  to add a hue to slightly modify the theme color
                </li>
                <li>
                  They also suggested a slight pivot in our creative direction,
                  preferring the ‚Äúpartifuliness‚Äù of the custom cover images

                  Concern about whether adding a pulsing cover image animation

                  Potentially shortening the flow for picking a song, since the
                  current modal to do so is multi-page
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consider adding even more customization options, such as

            to the interface were uniform with Partiful‚Äôs existing event page
            interface. All of the fonts, accent colors, and existing components
            as well as their interactive states did not change. In terms of the
            decisions Partiful made for their design system, we noticed that
            their accent colors were intentionally neon to stand out against any
            selected theme. Further, we noticed that they kept their font color
            white throughout the page to provide high contrast against all
            themes they have available. The use of the font style Syne is part
            of their brand identity, which is why it is the default title font.

            Our main changes that we adopted from the critiques were:
          </p>

          <ul className="text-14 list-disc list-inside ml-24">
            <li>
              We agreed with the feedback on the theme customization and decided
              to scrap our original AI and gradient ideas, instead implementing
              a similar interface with a simple slider to adjust the hue for
              each individual theme
            </li>
            <li>
              We also decided to add the feature for interactive cover images
              (particularly, those with face cutouts) as it seemed particularly
              ‚ÄúPartiful‚Äù in inducing unexpected delight from guests
            </li>
            <li>
              We ended up rejecting the studio feedback suggestions for more
              custom layouts, as we believed that the increase in layout options
              was more likely to be overwhelming for users while providing
              little benefit in ‚ÄúPartiful‚Äù expressiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
              We also were fine with the multi-page modal of the song selection
              flow, as combining everything into a single page modal didn‚Äôt seem
              necessary and would possibly lead to information overload
            </li>

            Part V: Final Founder Feedback & Next Steps
          </h2>

          <p className="text-14">
            After our final rounds of revisions and high-fidelity wireframing,
            we met with designers, engineers, and founders at Partiful to
            showcase our work. Overall, while received praise for our innovative
            designs which captured the &quot;Partiful&quot; spirit, we received
            a few points of feedback for each of our final flows:
          </p>

          <p className="text-14 underline font-bold"> Flow 1: Theme Hue Customization üé® </p>
          <ul className="text-14 list-disc list-inside ml-24">
            <li>
              Problem: It is unclear how to reset the theme to its original state
              from the current hue slider
            </li>
            <li>
              Solution: To fix this potential pain point, we decided that clicking
              the selected theme again or making the hue bar sticky could be
              mechanisms to revert the theme to its default color
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-14 underline font-bold">Flow 2: Title Font Customization ‚úçüèº </p>
          <ul className="text-14 list-disc list-inside ml-24">
            <li>
              Problem: The current font side pop up would likely not work with the
              small left margins on a mobile screen
            </li>
            <li>
              Solution: Making the font a pop up that goes right on
              top of the title font section with a horizontal scroll could
              solve this responsiveness issue
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-14 underline font-bold"> Flow 3: Music üé∂ </p>
          <ul className="text-14 list-disc list-inside ml-24">
            <li>
              Problem: The pop up for choosing an event theme song blocks the
              cover image, which makes the pulse animation difficult to preview
              unless the user fully exits the pop up. It is also unclear that the song
              clip duration selector is a drop down
            </li>
            <li>
              Solution: We came to a consensus that making sure the pulsing starts when the toggle
              is selected and making the pop up smaller would allow the user to demo and decide on
              the pulsing rather than repetitively going between the pop up and interface, and
              adding a small icon to the dropdown to make it more discoverable would solve the latter issue
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-14 underline font-bold">Flow 4: Partiful Your Guests üéâ </p>
          <ul className="text-14 list-disc list-inside ml-24">
            <li>
              Problem: While the font cover image and back ‚ÄúPartiful your guests‚Äù
              image flip on click, that clickable interaction is hard to realize
              for the user
            </li>
            <li>
              Solution: We successfully proposed that the cover could
              automatically flip every 5 seconds, although that could become
              overboard with the pulsing, or that there could be some icon to
              indicate the cover is flippable
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-14">
            If time permits, we would love to take this feedback into account
            and apply them to our Figma designs to further improve upon our
            existing wireframes!

          <p className="text-14">
            Overall, we had a ton of fun with this project and loved the
            experience working with Partiful (whose product we all use)!
          </p>

          <p className="text-14">
            The most valuable part of the iterative design process was receiving
            really specific, thoughtful feedback from our points of contact. We
            saw how important good feedback is as it illuminated crucial blind
            spots for us to consider that enabled us to refine and ultimately
            build a better product. Although we know that Partiful is more
            focused on building out the robustness of user networking on the
            platform to get more users right now, we hope that some of our ideas
            are implemented at some point. Regardless, we want to give Partiful
            a huge shoutout for giving us this wonderful opportunity to work
            with them on this project for the past few weeks!
